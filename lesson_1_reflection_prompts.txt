How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

In this way you can compare the differences to see if it's an typo or because of other gramma error.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

It helps you keep track of what changes have been made.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Google docs saves the file for you so you won't forget to do it manually. However, it may save too many useless versions.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because codes are usually linked to each other, unlike other text documents.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log to show all wersion id, git diff to compare two version.
+ means insertion, - means deletion.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

We could revert to the old version any time.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Save versions of all my projects.
